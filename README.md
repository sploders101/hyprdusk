# hyprdusk
My personalized desktop environment for Hyprland

This is the playground branch. I want a fully-customized DE based on Wayland, Hyprland, and GTK3 (I will upgrade to GTK4 when it gains enough traction), but I have no idea what I'm doing, so this is a completely separate part of the project that will never be merged, where I can put all my little experiments. Code in this repo will be dirty and bad; this is intentional; I'm just trying to keep my experiments accessible so they can serve as a reference.
